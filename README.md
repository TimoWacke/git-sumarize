Python Script to reduce your commit count forcefully without chaning contents.
Iterates through your commits, and summarizes commits during the same hour/minute (customizable) into one.

### You made way too many commits?
**Maybe you are using (https://obsidian.md)[Obsidian,md] with something like (https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)[obsidian-git]...**
Or maybe you are using any other automated commits, or you quick fixes have gotten too many and now you decide to clean the history up?

That can be hard... Rebasing and Squash might help, but will mostlikely run into thousands of merge conflicts.

I ended up writing a script, to do so. This helped me a lot.
